------------------------
Based on orca0.5 model.

Open the marcats.shp that is stored on my account on asterix.
/home/users/brock/marcats

1) pyferret
--> open and plot marcats cells of the model (orca 0.5)
--> save as svg with frame command
2) inkscape
--> open svg
--> save as DXF
3) qgis
--> open DXF
--> save as shapefile
--> clean the shapefile (remove shade of the color bar, the plot frame)
--> save again
