Attached is the data set that we would love to see used to make plots
analogous to what you did for the Carbon emissions, namely those you
showed this week at the Modeling animation (interactive Sankey diagram
and stacked bar charts).

The datafile is a .xls spreadsheet containing simulated air-sea CO2
fluxes into 45 different coastal regions. Those 45 regions are further
classed into 7 classes. Fluxes are given for 3 model resolutions 2°
(ORCA2), 0.5° (ORCA05), and 0.25° (ORCA025). If you are still willing
to take on this additional task, a great starting point would be to
focus only on ORCA05. Later the same analysis could be done for the
other 2 resolutions.

Recall: Total and natural fluxes can be positive or negative.
Anthropogenic fluxes are always negative.
total = natural + anthropogenic

In the table, results are given as specific fluxes, i.e., per unit area
[mol C / (m^2 yr)]. But the table also provides the area (km^2) of each
region, so it would be great to see a histogram of the specific flux and
of the area-integrated flux (by region).

For the air-sea flux analysis, there seems a near perfect analogy for
what you have already done with emissions, namely

Plot of Emissions Plot of Air-sea fluxes
======================== ======================
- Country MARCATS Region (45)
- Continent MARCATS Class (7)
- gas, coal, petrol, ... Natural carbon, total carbon (+anthropogenic)

Could we talk more about this today or tomorrow?

I think a dataviz on this would be very effective in communicating some
complicated results in a simple fashion. It would be great for
Timothée's thesis and our general effort at LSCE to effort at LSCE to
improve our representation of the coastal zone in global ocean carbon
models.

NOTES:

1) The table only shows fluxes of total carbon and anthropogenic carbon,
but the natural component is just computed by difference

carbon = total carbon - anthropogenic carbon

2) The fluxes for anthropogenic carbon are always negative (into the
ocean), while fluxes for natural carbon are both positive and negative
(from sea to air and from air to sea). So the analysis for the natural
and total carbon would be more complicated. For now, it seems best to
focus only on the anthropogenic flux (always the same sign).

3) The anthropogenic flux for the ORCA025 flux is missing, but Timothée
could add that soon.

The link below point directly to the supplementary material of the article above. This is a ZIP file that contains GIS files. The shapefile Continental_Shelf.shp delineate COSCAT regions (COSCAT regions are sub-unit of MARCATS regions). Each COSCAT region have an ID number for COSCAT and MARCATS. We need to focus only on MARCATS unit so we need to aggregate the COSCAT region that have the same MARCATS ID number. The MARCATS ID number are the same as in my paper and in the xls file sent yesterday.

I’ll send you anthropogenic fluxes for ORCA2 and ORCA025 asap.
